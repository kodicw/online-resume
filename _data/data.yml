        I implemented several initiatives to improve the efficiency and functionality of the company.

In addition, I introduced more efficient methods for installations, such as an installation cart and organized tools, and provided additional resources for clients through a bulletin board with QR code links. To further improve the experience of clients, I also implemented clear signage to communicate company policies.
